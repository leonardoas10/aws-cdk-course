# AWS CDK POC

### [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-typescript-cdk-serverless-react) :fire:

## Overview 🤔

This project is a proof of concept (POC) to explore and practice using AWS CDK.

Focuses on creating reusable AWS CDK stacks for common AWS services such as Lambda functions, DynamoDB, Cloudwatch, SNS, S3 buckets, and API Gateway.

## Objectives 📝

-   Practice using AWS CDK.
-   Generate reusable AWS CDK stacks.
-   Streamline the deployment and management of these services in a structured and efficient manner.

## Useful commands 🧪

-   `npm run build` compile typescript to js
-   `npm run watch` watch for changes and compile
-   `npm run test` perform the jest unit tests
-   `npx cdk deploy` deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
-   `npx cdk diff` compare deployed stack with current state
-   `npx cdk synth` emits the synthesized CloudFormation template

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.
